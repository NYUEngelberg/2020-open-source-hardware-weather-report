# Opportunities for Open Hardware

This report captures open source hardware at a 10 year anniversary.  The final section suggests some opportunities for the community in the next 10 years.


## Be More Intentional About Diversifying Open Source Hardware

OSHWA has taken significant steps to diversify the open source hardware community through the structure of the Open Hardware Summit.  The summit itself was founded by two female engineers: Ayah Bdeir and Alicia Gibb. It has historically included a majority of women in leadership roles, especially Addie Wagenknecht, who chaired the summit from 2013-2018.  In addition to being an early adopter of a code of conduct, the summit reserves approximately one-third of its entire budget for support of the Ada Lovelace Fellowship program.  The Ada Lovelace Fellowship program began as a program to encourage women to participate in the community, and has expanded over the years to support a wide range of participation from historically underrepresented groups.  The summit also structures and regularly evaluates its speaker selection process to promote a diversity of presentations.

GOSH has also embedded principles of equity and diversity into its community from the start.  It has centered these values through its manifesto and detailed [code of conduct](http://openhardware.science/gosh-2017/gosh-code-of-conduct/).  GOSH has also held major events [beyond the United States](http://openhardware.science/gatherings/) and outside of the global north, including in locations such as [Chile](http://openhardware.science/gosh-2017/) and [China](http://openhardware.science/gatherings/gosh-2018-2/).  These foundational decisions have helped to foster robust regional communities, including [AfricaOSH](http://africaosh.com/) and, in Latin America, [reGOSH](https://regosh.libres.cc/).

Most recently, the [community resolution to redefine SPI pin names](https://www.oshwa.org/2020/06/29/a-resolution-to-redefine-spi-pin-names/) is an important step toward recognizing how structures and terminology within hardware can exclude potential participants in open source hardware.

These types of steps arguably make the open hardware community more diverse than some other open source communities.  Women serve in major leadership roles in the open source hardware community.  Alicia Gibb is the president of the Open Source Hardware Association.  Jenny Molloy and Shannon Dosemagen are key leaders in GOSH. Women are at the center of a number of successful open source hardware companies, including Limor Fried at Adafruit and Lenore Edman at Evil Mad Scientist.  Naomi Wu is one of the most vocal advocates for open source hardware approaches online and in China.

Nonetheless, these efforts have not yet succeeded in cultivating as broadly diverse a community as the community needs.  The open hardware community must continue to work to diversify itself both by creating a welcoming space for all creators and by actively reaching out to invite those diverse makers into the community.

In addition to striving toward a diversity of creators, the open source hardware community will continue to work to diversify how it defines hardware itself.  Although there are important exceptions, today’s open source hardware skews toward electronics.  Outdoor equipment, board games, educational tools, and physical art installations are also open hardware and should be more fully recognized as such.


## Expand Academic Pathways

Some of open source hardware’s strongest advocates and practitioners come from academia.  The GOSH community has made strides in integrating open source hardware and science.  Unfortunately, because academic recognition is centered on patent applications, it can often be hard for those academic advocates to receive recognition from their professional peers for contributions to open source hardware.

Academic hiring and promotion committees have processes in place to review contributions that are documented in patent applications.  They are less comfortable evaluating contributions to important open source hardware projects.  The open source hardware community will work to make it easier for academic communities to track and recognize open contributions from their peers to the open source hardware community.


## Openness Requirements in Grantmaking

The open access movement has been incredibly successful in building openness requirements into major grants.  Today many grantmakers require research papers to be licensed under Creative Commons licenses and data to be freely available to others.

There is no reason that these types of requirements cannot extend to hardware funded by these same grantmakers.  OSHWA’s open source hardware certification program makes it easy for grantmakers to verify compliance with these types of requirements. Just as a Creative Commons license acts as a guarantee that research papers are openly licensed, an OSHWA certification can verify that any hardware created under a grant meets the requirements of the open source hardware definition.


## Create Model Repositories

Open source hardware is already broad enough to make it a challenge to identify one ‘right’ way to structure a project.  Nonetheless, there are steps that the community can take to make it easier for newcomers to get started in open source hardware.

One obvious approach is to create model repositories for open source hardware.  These repositories can clearly structure hardware and software files. The readme files can structure documentation in a standardized way, as well as present licensing information in a common format.

These model repositories would not be intended to become a required form for open source hardware.  Nonetheless, they can help shape expectations by providing clear starting points for new projects and reference structures for projects interested in organizing data in a way that is clear for users.


## Develop Open Components

One of the strengths of open source software is that any given open source software project is created from building blocks made up of other open source software components.  That is rarely the case with today’s open source hardware.  While the hardware itself may be open, it is usually built from proprietary - although commonly available - components.

In time, there is value in cultivating an open ecosystem of components to complement higher-level open source hardware projects. These open components can give the community even more flexibility in designing and creating hardware, as well as a deeper understanding of how the components truly work. This may feed into an even richer open source hardware ecosystem.


## Improve Open Design Tools

The open source hardware community is made up of people who can design and improve open source hardware. Today, the process of learning these design skills is an involved one.  Most tools are proprietary and expensive, and free tools can lack usability and power features.

This feeds a dynamic where only a relatively small portion of the community has the skills and tools required to contribute back to open source hardware projects.  Many of today’s open source hardware projects note that contributions to the hardware components of open source hardware are often dwarfed by the contributions to the project’s software components.  This is, at least in part, due to the larger number of community members with the skills and tools required to contribute to software.  Making it easier to access and use hardware design tools could significantly expand the pool of people with the ability to contribute back to projects.

Creating easy-to-use, powerful hardware design tools is no simple task. Nonetheless, doing so could fundamentally alter the contribution dynamic within open source hardware and greatly accelerate its growth.


# Conclusion

The first 10 years of open source hardware have been incredibly successful.  What started as a largely theoretical approach to hardware design has blossomed into a real, vibrant ecosystem and community.  Open source hardware has proven itself to be flexible, adaptable, and robust.

This was not inevitable and is rightly celebrated by the community.  This report captures some of those successes. It also recognizes that the open source hardware community continues to grow and evolve.  By identifying key trends and opportunities, it helps the community communicate with itself, consider priorities, and move forward into the next 10 years.

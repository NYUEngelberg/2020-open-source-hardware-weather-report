# When Does it Make Sense to Use Open Source Hardware?

If open source hardware is a tool, when is it most effectively deployed?  Some of the most successful open source hardware projects incorporate one - or many - of the following scenarios.


## When Using it to Set a Standard

Open source hardware is well positioned to define a standard because everyone involved has equal control of it into the future.  A community or industry that does not have mutual trust can work together to build an open standard that defines a collective, interoperable starting point for further innovation.

One of the most prominent examples of this type of standard setting is the form factor and layout of the original Arduino microcontroller boards.  The original Arduino’s shape, size, and pin layout formed the basis of countless add-ons designed to sit on top of the Arduino.  The open nature of the Arduino gave these additional builders confidence that, even if Arduino itself abandoned the shape, it would be easy for others to continue to manufacture boards that would be compatible with the accessories.  Similarly, a new generation of ‘feather-compatible’ boards, built to be compatible with the open source microcontroller boards developed by Adafruit, prove that standards can continue to evolve in the open community as needs and interests diversify.

Openness has also fueled standardization in device interoperability across companies.  Adafruit’s [STEMMA](https://learn.adafruit.com/introducing-adafruit-stemma-qt/what-is-stemma), Seeed Studio’s [Grove](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Grove_System/), and Sparkfun’s [Qwiic](https://www.sparkfun.com/qwiic) are largely mutually compatible ways to connect development boards, sensors, and other components.

Open source hardware has also helped to standardize open source scripting languages to hardware.   [Circuitpython](https://circuitpython.org/) is now supported in a [wide range](https://circuitpython.org/downloads) of open source electronics, and the open source nature of those electronics makes it easy to adapt them for even more uses.  There are also active projects bringing [Go](https://tinygo.org/) and [Rust](https://rust-embedded.github.io/blog/) to electronics. The evolution from IDEs to scripting environments has made it easier for many creators to quickly move into hardware, and to shift between different platforms.


## When Encouraging Hackers

Some hardware is specifically designed to be hacked, modified, improved, and torn apart.  It assumes that its community has the technical skills to make modifications and the inclination to do so.

Open source hardware is perfect for these kinds of communities.  The documentation makes it easy for the community to understand how the hardware works and the licensing eliminates legal barriers to modifying - and distributing modifications of - the hardware.  Open source hardware becomes a clear invitation to hacking communities to gather around the project and contribute to its evolution.


## When Designing to Teach or Train

Similarly, many open source hardware projects are explicitly designed to teach users about the hardware itself.  Even if those users do not start with the skills required to modify the hardware, open documentation can help them explore its workings and understand how various elements work together.  It can also incentivise learners, giving them the confidence that once they understand the hardware, they will be free to take it in new directions.

This approach to teaching can be focused on the hardware itself by teaching users how a given piece of hardware operates.  It can also be focused on teaching users broader concepts connected to hardware design and operation, with the open hardware itself becoming merely a tool toward that larger goal.


## When Targeting a Non-Commodity Market

Some open source hardware projects are designed to succeed by targeting higher-end, non-commodity markets.  This approach is most successful for hardware that is technically complex to manufacture or calibrate.  In those situations, even if competitors are able to access the schematics and technical information about a hardware project, few are likely to have the capacity to create the hardware with the level of precision it requires to work effectively, or to support it in a way that meets user expectations.

Many users of this type of precision equipment are themselves technically sophisticated.  As a result, they place a high value on openly available technical information about the hardware, and may take the opportunity to contribute improvements back to the project.


## When You Want to Turn Users into Advocates

Open source hardware can help create trust among projects and communities.  This trust can create a group of user-advocates who are deeply invested in the success of the project.  They work to improve the hardware as part of their collective endeavor and advocate for the use of the project in a wide variety of circumstances.

Openness plays a key role in this trust, for at least two reasons. First, it gives users confidence that their contributions will not merely be locked away by the project team without benefiting the community.  Second, if the original project team does lose the confidence of the community, the community knows that it can simply take the project somewhere else.


## When You Have Trusted Documentation and Manufacturing Quality That Set You Apart

While in theory anyone can manufacture a piece of open source hardware, not everyone can manufacture it in a way that reliably matches user expectations and the original documentation.  Developing a reputation for reliability, accuracy, and support can help a project succeed when it is competing against lower-quality clones.

It is true that, in some cases, clones will be ‘good enough’ to compete against the nominally higher-quality versions.  However, for applications where quality matters, open source approaches can help build a community without undermining a competitive position.


## When Engaging Your Community is at the Center of the Project

As described in this section, open source hardware provides a solid foundation for community building around projects.  While strong communities are not key to the success of all projects, projects centered on community will often find that open approaches bring strong benefits.

# When Does it Not Make Sense to Use Open Source Hardware?

Open source hardware is not always a successful approach.  Projects with the following characteristics may find that the costs associated with sustaining an open source hardware project outweigh the benefits of the approach.


## When it Targets a Community Primarily Interested in Non-Modifiable or Expandable Projects

Open source hardware allows a community of users to modify and expand the hardware in order to take it in new directions.  However, not every project is targeting a market that values that type of flexibility.  If a project is primarily geared toward communities who are unlikely to care about how the project works, let alone having the opportunity to modify it, the project may not be a good candidate for an open source-based approach.  This is especially true because, in at least some cases, optimizing designs for openness can involve tradeoffs in other areas.  If the users of the product are unlikely to engage with its open nature, the project may be better served by focusing on things that the users do prioritize.


## When Maintaining Public Documentation is in Conflict with Other Goals

Although this is not a universally held view, some members of the open source hardware community have noted that maintaining accurate and useful public documentation distracted from the core mission of the project and diverted resources away from other priorities.  While some projects embrace open source hardware in part to instill a discipline around internal documentation practices, other projects feel that rigorous public documentation requirements create an additional step in the engineering process.

If your internal project documentation requires significant revision to be shared, and that revision process will draw critical resources from elsewhere, you may find that the open approach is not a good fit for the project.


## When Maintaining a Community is in Conflict with Other Goals

Project communities do not simply appear.  Fostering a community requires a real investment of time and resources, both in its initial creation and ongoing health.  Some projects see this role as central, of equal value to engineering and design.  Others view community development as a competitor to more important priorities.

If your project team is uninterested in investing in growing a community, that community is unlikely to develop.  As such, the team should reflect on its community development prioritization before moving forward with an open source approach.  If the team decides that community development is a distraction from the core of the project, an open approach may not be an ideal fit.


## When Open Source Hardware is Viewed as a Replacement for Marketing

Some projects hope that simply ‘open sourcing’ their hardware will create a market and community for the project.  As with community building, open source hardware can be a key part of a marketing strategy.  It cannot, however, be a replacement for a marketing strategy.

Successful open source hardware projects still need to take the steps that any successful project takes, including marketing to communities and users.  This report documents numerous ways that an open source approach can help develop and sustain a community.  Nonetheless, that development and sustainability is not self-executing.  Open source approaches are not a shortcut to success.

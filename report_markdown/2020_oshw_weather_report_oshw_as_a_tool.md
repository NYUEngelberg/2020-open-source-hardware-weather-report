# Open Source Hardware as a Tool

Open source hardware is a tool. Like any tool, it can be effective in some situations and detrimental in others.  Distinguishing between those situations requires understanding what it really means to use open source hardware.  This section describes the costs and benefits of an open source hardware approach in relation to the creators’ goals.  It will help you understand what it really means to build a successful open source hardware project and if open source hardware development is the right tool for the job.


## Open Source Hardware Has Real Benefits

Open source hardware can bring tremendous benefits when it is used correctly. Some of these benefits are obvious. Others emerge in time.


### An Engaged Community

The community is the not-so-secret key to most open source hardware projects’ success.  An open hardware project’s community feels personally invested in the project. That can make the community a peerless advocate for the project, recruiting new users and identifying new uses. Communities are also challenging for competitors to copy.

The open nature of open source hardware means that the community has an incentive to improve the hardware and contribute those improvements back to the project.  Open licenses are designed to prevent project leaders from simply integrating community suggestions into proprietary products.

The community can also be a buffer against competitors.  Many open hardware projects survive in an environment where they compete against lower-priced competitors on the strength of their community advocacy and loyalty.

Furthermore, open source hardware is not merely an invitation to modify or improve the hardware itself.  A project’s community is often the source of accessories, new applications, and complementary projects that expand the range of uses for the underlying projects.


### Setting a Standard

Open source hardware projects can become a de-facto standard in their field.  The players in a space feel confident building around open projects because their very openness eliminates the risk that the results of this collective effort will become unavailable in the future.  Open source hardware gives everyone a common reference point that can evolve along with the needs of the community.

An open standard allows everyone who relies on it to collectively improve the standard without fear of empowering a proprietary competitor.  It can also allow everyone to create their own version of the standard without running afoul of restrictive licensing terms.


### Collaborative Development

One barrier to collaborative development is the fear that one’s work will be ‘taken advantage of’ by one player in the space. Open licensing can force all of the collaborators to play by the same rules, encouraging a sense of common mission that can inspire collaborative development.  The very openness of open source hardware acts as a hedge against each collaborator’s work disappearing behind a proprietary veil.


### Network of Advocates

Many successful open source hardware projects draw an explicit connection between their openness and the strength of their advocacy networks.  The community built up around open source hardware is constantly looking for new applications and opportunities for the project.  These communities are also often sources of support when disputes arise between open source hardware projects and competitors.  This support can take a range of forms, from public advocacy to financial support.


## Open Source Hardware requires real investment

Open source hardware does not just happen.  It requires real work on the part of the community supporting the project.  Some of the most significant costs cited by open source hardware community members are:


### Maintaining Public Documentation

Open source hardware relies on open documentation. That includes schematics and design files for the hardware, software, and documentation.  One key obligation of any open source hardware project is maintaining a publicly accessible repository of documentation related to the project.

As discussed later in this report, there is something of a split in the community as to how significant of a burden maintaining public documentation places on the project maintainers.  This split largely flows from how closely a project’s internal workflow inherently mirrors what is required of public documentation.  In some cases, maintaining public versions of documentation requires building an entire parallel infrastructure. In others, it simply involves making existing design documents public.  Whatever the case, publishing and maintaining the public documentation will require some amount of resources from the project team.

Nonetheless, it would be short sighted to simply view documentation as a cost of developing open source hardware.  Robust documentation fuels real collaboration, which is a foundational strength of open source hardware.  Documentation is what allows a local modification to be adopted worldwide, and an individual insight to become the global standard.  Documentation is the foundation of open source hardware.


### Collaborating with the Community

There are many examples of both open and closed hardware projects that rely on robust communities for their success.  In both cases, these successful communities do not simply appear.  Instead, they are the result of careful work and resources allocated by the projects.  The importance of intentional community building is not a unique challenge for the open source hardware community.  However, because community building is often a key element of open source hardware success, it is worth examining here.

Most successful open source hardware projects rely on an active community to champion its use, provide feedback, and contribute improvements.  These successful projects prove that it is quite possible to build successful open source, community-based projects.

Community engagement can take a number of different forms depending on the nature of the project.  Regardless of the form, cultivating and sustaining this community requires dedicated time from the project team.  Open source hardware projects that overlook the importance of community engagement or view it as a secondary concern are rarely successful.  Launching an open source hardware project without devoting resources to building and maintaining a community is similar to launching a product without dedicating resources to marketing.  The project will exist in the world, but it is unlikely that users and customers will find it.

Open and closed projects that rely on community engagement require dedicated resources to manage those communities. While open source hardware projects that intend to rely on communities must take steps to support those communities, those obligations are functionally identical to the steps that any community-dependent project needs to take.  If the team does not have the resources to devote to community cultivation, neither an open nor a closed community-based strategy is likely to be successful.


### Answering Questions

Closely related to community engagement more broadly, successful open source hardware projects tend to receive questions from their community.  While these questions can help the project team identify problems, as well as improve the hardware and accompanying documentation, they can also divert resources away from the core development of the hardware itself.  If the project team lacks the interest or capacity to handle questions (or even create a system to triage them), they are less likely to find open source hardware to be a successful approach.

Similarly, scaling the capacity to answer questions should be part of any project’s roadmap.  That does not mean that the team needs to start with the capacity to engage with many more questions than they receive at the start.  Instead, a structure for answering questions should be designed to scale the same way production and sourcing might - over time and in response to growth.


### Competing Against Copies

Open source hardware is designed to be copied.  This is key to its strengths in fostering community, collaboration, and diverse applications.  However, it can also result in projects competing directly with copies.

Successful open source hardware projects use many strategies to operate in a world with copies. Cultivating active communities, innovating faster than competitors, fostering a reputation for superior build quality, and developing exceptional user support are all ways to distinguish successful projects from their competitors.

While each of these strategies can be successful, they require intentionality, resources, and time to implement. If these types of strategies - and other strategies highlighted in this report - are poor fits for a project, open source hardware may not be an appropriate strategy.


## Hardware is Not Software

Although open source hardware shares a history and ideology with open source software, the two are distinct in meaningful ways.  Understanding the differences between hardware and software is especially important for community members joining the open source hardware world from the open source software world.


### Every Piece of Hardware is Unique

Creating perfect copies of software is easy.  Every user who downloads a program creates a copy that is identical to the original and to every other copy.  That means that anyone can become a distributor of a piece of software, offering perfect versions to all comers.

Hardware is very different.  Creating hardware relies on manipulating the physical world, which means navigating imperfections.  Given the exact same design files, 10 different manufacturers will create 10 pieces of hardware that differ from one another in ways large and small.

As a result, the manufacturer and distributor of hardware - the manufacturer and distributor of a given physical piece of hardware, not the creator of the original design - has more influence on the quality of an individual instance of that hardware than the distributor of software would have on an individual copy of the software.  The entity responsible for the actual piece of open source hardware in your possession is much more important than the server hosting the open source software you download.

Many successful open source hardware projects use this difference to their advantage.  They cultivate reputations for high-quality manufacture, not just high-quality open source designs.  Two providers of identical software may be reduced to competing on cost.  Two providers of identical hardware will still compete on cost.  However, they will also compete on build quality in a way that is not relevant in the software world.


### Open Source Hardware is Not Expected to be Free (as in Beer)

In addition to being perfect, reproducing software is also free.  The lack of a marginal cost for software reproduction has created a wariness in the open source software community around selling software.  This wariness also creates a generalized suspicion of payments connected to the use of open source software in many parts of the community.

In contrast, there are real marginal costs for reproducing hardware.  Hardware is made up of stuff, and building and shipping stuff (as opposed to bits) costs money.  Even an open source hardware project operating at cost will have to charge users (or raise funds) in order to get hardware to users.

One result of this dynamic is that the open source hardware community is much more comfortable with the idea of charging for - and paying for - hardware projects.  That comfort extends beyond simply covering costs into supporting the building of sustainable businesses.  This is why open source hardware companies built on selling the hardware itself form a significant portion of the open source hardware community. It also provides a welcoming path for new members of the community hoping to create financially successful open source hardware.


### Scale Matters in Hardware

Because each piece of hardware needs to be physically assembled, scale can be much more important in the world of open source hardware than it is in open source software.  The process of creating and distributing 5, 50, 500, or 5,000 copies of a software package is largely identical.  In hardware, the processes for creating and distributing 5, 50, 500, or 5,000 pieces of hardware can be fundamentally different.  Parts availability, assembly steps, and quality control processes can be very different, depending on how many pieces of hardware you are creating.

As a result, it is much more important to plan for your initial distribution scale in hardware than it is in software.  While this is not a unique requirement when comparing _open source_ hardware to _closed source_ hardware, it does become unique when comparing open source _hardware_ to open source _software_.  Many members of the open source hardware community come from the open source software community (as opposed to the closed source hardware community), so recognizing this distinction has been hard won.

# There Are Unresolved Challenges in the Open Source Hardware Community

The open source hardware community is vibrant and growing.  As it grows, engaging with a broader range of users, uses, and communities, it encounters new challenges.  One purpose of this report is to help document the challenges that have largely been resolved.  That allows everyone to learn those lessons quickly.

Another purpose of this report is to identify challenges under active discussion within the community. At a minimum, that may help members of the community struggling with these challenges feel less alone.  More ambitiously, documenting these challenges can make it easier for the open source hardware community to work together toward solutions.


## Is Open Source Hardware Documentation a Barrier to Opening a Project?

As discussed elsewhere in this report, there are divergent views about the burdens involved with publicly documenting open source hardware projects.

Some view creating public documentation as a straightforward extension of good internal engineering and design principles.  This view prioritizes the act of creating clean, accurate documentation as a necessary step in any design project.  Under this view, both open and closed projects should be creating documentation that is immediately usable by others as a matter of course.  Within this context, the public version of the documentation is essentially identical to the internal working version.  This all but eliminates any burden associated with creating public versions of documentation.

An alternative view understands internal documentation to exist at a significantly lower standard than is necessary for public documentation.  This view does not prize creating complete internal documentation.  In light of the state of internal documentation, the act of creating public versions of the documentation that are useful to community members outside of the project can be burdensome and distracting.  The resources required to overcome this burden can prove to be a significant barrier to adopting an open approach.

It may be that both of these views are correct, insomuch as they reflect two distinct, but equally viable, approaches to design.  Nonetheless, the split is real and contributes to some level of frustration within the community. In some ways the correct approach for a given project is tied to the alignment between its internal style of documentation and its intended users.  Unstructured internal documentation approaches for a project targeting beginners are likely to require significant additional work to create the public documentation.  The same unstructured approach for a project targeting users comfortable with the technology may require significantly less preparation before being released.


## Should the Community Distinguish Between Levels of Openness?

The Open Source Hardware [Definition](https://www.oshwa.org/definition/) establishes a clear test for what is, and is not, open source hardware.  OSHWA’s [open source hardware certification program](https://certification.oshwa.org/) approaches this distinction as a binary one: hardware that meets the definition is certified as open source hardware, hardware that does not meet the definition is not.

It is also possible to view open hardware as more of a spectrum.  Open hardware that incorporates proprietary components can currently meet the standards of the definition as long as those components are generally available on the market without having to sign an NDA to access them.  Should the community celebrate hardware that goes beyond that obligation, by striving to integrate (and even create) open components?  Should that celebration be structured to avoid reducing the recognition of hardware that ‘merely’ meets the definition’s requirement?  Would this approach further confuse the definition of open source hardware?


## Is There a Place for Almost, or Aspirationally, Open Hardware?

The open source hardware community is rightfully wary of ‘open washing’ - the practice of hardware projects claiming to be open without meeting the definition of openness. Whether motivated by cynical marketing instincts or ignorance, promoting non-open hardware as open undermines confidence in open source hardware.

Nonetheless, there are projects that fulfill many of the requirements of openness, or that aspire in good faith to become open one day.  Should the open hardware community distinguish these projects from other non-open hardware? If so, what should that distinction mean?

Furthermore, is there value in intentionally engaging with aspirationally open hardware projects? If so, what are the best mentorship and pathway-building strategies to enable aspirationally open hardware to become fully open hardware?


## Is it Productive to View Open Hardware as More than a Dichotomy?

The open source hardware community often views hardware as being either open or closed.  There is an alternative approach that offers three categories: open, non-open, and closed.

Under this rubric, open hardware is hardware that fully complies with the open source hardware definition.  Closed hardware is hardware that is actively closed, where the creator does not share design files and uses property rights to exclude others.

The third category, non-open hardware, identifies hardware where the project team has not taken intentional steps to embrace either approach.  They may share some design files but have no systems in place to make sure that all design files are shared. While non-open creators may not openly license their rights, they also do not actively enforce their rights against others.

The non-open hardware category encompasses a vast middle ground of creators, both casual and commercial.  These projects are not open in the sense that they comply with the definition.  Should the community view them as fully closed?


## Is “Just Copying” Wrong?

Many members of the open source hardware community focus on the freedom that open source hardware gives them to modify, improve, and redesign hardware.  This embodies a vision where open source allows others to build upon existing hardware.

While this is a key benefit of open source hardware, the open source hardware approach also allows others to simply copy the original design.

This type of copying causes some projects to avoid open hardware approaches, and causes others to leave the community.  As such, many members of the community view it in a negative light.  Others view copying as the best compliment their work can receive.  Are there other ways to understand the behavior?

Although many exciting applications of open source hardware involve modifying the hardware itself, many celebrated uses of open source hardware are simply situations where open hardware has been used in unexpected contexts.  Does that suggest that open hardware projects do not need to be modified in order to be successful, and that copies can achieve these goals as well?  Is this dynamic unique to open source hardware, or is it similar to the dynamic in other open communities?

Someone who makes an identical, but lower cost, copy makes that hardware more accessible to more users.  This accessibility comes at a cost - it may undermine the incentive to innovate in the first place or continue to innovate in the future - but it also brings benefits -  the hardware is available in  a way that it was not before.  How should the community take this into account?

Is it useful to distinguish between copies that exist in a richly collaborative ecosystem and copies that exist in an otherwise low-engagement community?  Put another way, are mere copies less bad if other parts of the community are actively contributing back to the project?

How broadly should the concept of ‘copies’ be applied?  Many successful open source hardware projects are replicated using locally sourced materials that differ from the original design.  Should these localized versions be considered copies?  If so, should the community approach them differently?
